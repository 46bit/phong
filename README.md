# Phong

Play Pong by plugging and unplugging your phones!

This is currently a very rough version. It's hardcoded that player 1 is my own phone.

## Usage

This runs on Python 3.

To install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the two-player Pong ("phong") game:

```
python phong.py
```
